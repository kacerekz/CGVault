# Reader's Diary Index

The index page should serve as a place to find short descriptions of the entries in this folder. This can make the readers interested in a text, or turn them away from disappointing pieces of writing.

```ad-tip
This category is where notes from reading academic articles or books can go.
```

```ad-zuzka
It's mainly intended as a place to keep our notes. We will need to read many books and these notes should contain enough information to remind us about their contents, places we might want to go back to, and things we might want to incorporate in our own text.
