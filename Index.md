## Introduction

This is the main page of the Computer Graphics knowledge base repository. It links to every topic contained in the repository. Topics are marked as **[Complete]** when completed. Topics under construction are marked as **[WIP]**. Unmarked topics are expected to be completed at some point in the future, in an unspecified order.

The topics should be explained clearly, in such a way that only a minimal grasp of mathematics and programming would be required to understand them. Readers should be able to comprehend the text at a first reading, and, given appropriate effort, replicate the exercises.

```ad-info
A student with a high school level understanding of mathematics should be able to comprehend the theoretical part of the text.
```

```ad-example
A student who has completed an introductory university level course in programming should not have trouble following the excersises. 
```

Readers experiencing difficulties with the material should contact us at Discord. Our goal is to achieve maximum clarity. We rely on our readers to inform us about sections of the text that may assume knowledge they shouldn't, or that simply aren't clear.
