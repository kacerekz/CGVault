Writing math is easy.  $e^{2i\pi} = 1$. Here. Or like this:

$$\begin{vmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$

Code examples work just the same:

``` java
public static void Main(string[] args){
	// this is a Java code block
}
```

Inserting working code demos might be more tricky.

I'll have to find a plugin that runs WebGL, or link to examples. I might also consider making such a plugin. I will also work on git integration and setting up a fully working repo on GitHub.
