OOP & ZSWI start some design pattern explanations but this could be taken further. Refer to the online Design Patterns book, it's very good but doesn't go terribly deep, as far as I remember. There are many places to learn about design patterns, but despite trying to learn about them, I'm still not clear on which ones I should keep in the back of my mind.
